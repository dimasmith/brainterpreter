# Brainterpreter

An interpreter for a toy programming language.
Created for TechIn talks in [Levi9](https://www.levi9.com/).

NOTE: it is a sandbox of the implementation.
I plan to deliver a new repository with the same functionality but better suited for education.

An interpreter is created as an educational experiment.
The main goal is to run the interpreter of [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) written in this toy language. You can check a "hello, world" in `examples` section.

## The language needs a name

Please suggest one.

## What's inside?

The repository containts parser, compiler, and virtual machine for a toy programming language.
The language has C-like syntax. Supported features:

- arithmetics;
- strings;
- boolean values;
- if statement;
- while loop;
- arrays;

## Syntax reference

In progress. Please take a look into the `examples` directory.

## Documentation

Please check the [project pages](https://dimasmith.github.io/brainterpreter/) for some docs.

Documenting is still very much in progress.
