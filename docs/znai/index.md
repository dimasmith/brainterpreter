# Bauble

Warning: Documentation is under active development (fancy word for incomplete). 

Bauble is a toy programming language for fun and education.
Look - we even have a nice logo!

It is created for a TechIn conference talk called `Brainpreter`.
The initial idea of the talk was to create a [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter.
The presentation would show main principles of creating programming languages.
But the joke went too far, and as a result we created a procedural programming language.
It has a parser, compiler, and its own stack virtual machine. 

One can create a Brainfuck interpreter using this language.
Essentially, that's what we did for the conference talk.

Do not: use Bauble in production. It's a toy. It has its name for a reason.
